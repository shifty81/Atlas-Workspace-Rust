  - [x] Owns ViewportHostRegistry, ViewportSurfaceRegistry, ViewportSceneProviderRegistry, ViewportFrameLoop, ViewportCompositor, GizmoRenderer
  - [x] `requestViewport(toolId, bounds)` / `releaseViewport(handle)` — slot lifecycle (release also unregisters surface)
  - [x] `activateViewport(handle)` / `pauseViewport(handle)` / `resumeViewport(handle)` — state transitions
  - [x] `updateBounds(handle, bounds)` / `setRenderMode(handle, mode)` / `setCamera(handle, cam)` — slot configuration
  - [x] `registerSurface(handle, surface*)` / `unregisterSurface(handle)` — GPU surface binding (not owned)
  - [x] `registerSceneProvider(toolId, provider*)` / `unregisterSceneProvider(toolId)` — scene injection (not owned)

  - [x] `activeHandles()` — collect active slot handles (useful for computeLayout call)
  - [x] Sub-registry accessors: `viewportRegistry()`, `surfaceRegistry()`, `sceneRegistry()`, `compositor()`, `frameLoop()`, `gizmoRenderer()`
- [x] Add `Tests/Workspace/test_phase65_viewport_manager.cpp` — 46 test cases / 128 assertions:
  - [x] Construction (3 tests): default state, default layout, sub-registry accessors
  - [x] requestViewport/releaseViewport (8 tests): valid handle, invalid bounds, empty toolId, multiple slots, release, unknown release, findSlot null, findSlot after request

## Phase 66 – Viewport Wiring (End-to-End)

**Status: Done**

- [x] Fix `GDIViewportSurface::bind()` — `m_bound = true` was inside `#if defined(_WIN32)` block, failing on Linux/CI; moved outside platform guard
- [x] Verify 9 wiring gaps (WorkspaceShell→tool→surface→panel) all covered by tests:
  - [x] Gap 1: `WorkspaceShell::viewportManager()` accessor (mutable + const)
  - [x] Gap 2: `IHostedTool::onAttachInput(InputSystem*)` / `onDetachInput()` hooks
  - [x] Gap 3: `SceneEditorTool` implements `IViewportSceneProvider`; activate() requests slot + registers provider; suspend() releases both
  - [x] Gap 4: `WorkspaceViewportBridge::connect()` sets panel handle + resize callback; `disconnect()` tears down
  - [x] Gap 5: `WorkspaceViewportBridge::forwardFrameResults()` routes colorAttachmentId to matching panel
  - [x] Gap 6: `ViewportFrameLoop::setGizmoRenderer()` / `gizmoRenderer()`; gizmo pass composited per rendered slot
  - [x] Gap 7: `GDIViewportSurface` — default invalid, resize→valid, bind/unbind cycle, colorAttachment non-zero, zero-resize invalidates
  - [x] Gap 8: `SceneEditorTool::update()` submits Translate/Rotate/Scale gizmos when selection > 0; no gizmo in Select mode or with no selection
  - [x] Gap 9: Full round-trip: shell→tool→surface→frame loop→panel produces correct colorAttachment
- [x] Add `Tests/Workspace/test_phase66_viewport_wiring.cpp` — 38 test cases / 80 assertions
- [x] Wire `NF_Phase66Tests` into Tests/CMakeLists.txt

**Success Criteria:**
- All 9 viewport wiring gaps verified with tests ✓
- GDIViewportSurface bind/unbind works on non-Windows platforms ✓
- Full round-trip: shell initialize → tool activate → surface register → renderFrame → panel updated ✓
- 38 test cases pass (80 assertions) ✓

## Phase 67 – Workspace Asset Browser

**Status: Done**

- [x] Create `WorkspaceAssetBrowser.h` — query-driven asset browser model over AssetCatalog
  - [x] `AssetBrowserSortMode` enum (ByName/ByType/ByPath/ByImportTime/BySize) + `assetBrowserSortModeName()`
  - [x] `AssetBrowserFilter` — typeMask, importStateMask, namePattern (case-insensitive), pathPrefix, maxResults, sortMode; `acceptsType()`, `acceptsImportState()`, `isEmpty()`, `clear()`
  - [x] `AssetBrowserEntry` — id, displayName, catalogPath, typeTag, importState, thumbnailCookie; `isValid()`
  - [x] `AssetBrowserState` — filter + results (MAX_RESULTS=2048) + selectedId; `hasSelection()`, `selectedEntry()`, `clearSelection()`, `clear()`; dirty flag
  - [x] `AssetBrowser` — non-owning catalog pointer; `setCatalog()`, `setFilter()`, `clearFilter()`, `refresh()` (applies all filter dimensions + sort + maxResults cap + deselects missing); `select()`, `clearSelection()`, `selectedEntry()`, `reset()`; refresh + selection observer callbacks (MAX_OBSERVERS=8 each)
- [x] Add `Tests/Workspace/test_phase67_asset_browser.cpp` — 41 test cases / 102 assertions:
  - [x] AssetBrowserSortMode (1 test): all 5 name helpers
  - [x] AssetBrowserFilter (5 tests): default accepts all types, typeMask, importStateMask, default state mask, isEmpty/clear
  - [x] AssetBrowserEntry (2 tests): default invalid, valid
  - [x] AssetBrowserState (4 tests): default no selection, selectedEntry nullptr, clearSelection, clear

  - [x] Filter — type mask (1 test): only matching types
  - [x] Filter — import state mask (1 test): dirty+error mask
  - [x] Filter — name pattern (2 tests): case-insensitive displayName, catalogPath match
  - [x] Filter — path prefix (1 test): subtree filter
  - [x] Filter — maxResults (1 test): cap enforced
  - [x] clearFilter (1 test): marks dirty + resets
  - [x] Sort modes (3 tests): ByName ascending, ByType ascending, ByPath ascending
  - [x] Selection (5 tests): select valid id, select missing id, clearSelection, selectedEntry, refresh deselects missing
  - [x] Observers (4 tests): refresh fires with count, selection fires on select, clearObservers, MAX_OBSERVERS enforced
  - [x] Reset (1 test): clears catalog + state + observers
  - [x] Integration (2 tests): multi-filter pipeline, full selection round-trip

- Observer callbacks fire on refresh (with count) and on select (with id) ✓
- 41 test cases pass (102 assertions) ✓

## Phase 68 – TextInput Typed-Text Wiring (Audit Patch 4)

**Status: Done**

Implements the text-input wiring fixes identified in `auditxtras.md` Patch 4.
Before this phase, `TextInput::handleInput()` only tracked click-to-focus; typed
characters were never consumed from `IInputContext`, so the widget was visually
interactive but functionally a read-only display.

- [x] Add `typedText()` pure-virtual method to `IInputContext` (Interfaces.h)
  — returns `std::string_view` of characters typed this frame; `'\b'`=Backspace, `'\r'`=Enter
- [x] Implement `setTypedText()` / `typedText()` in `BasicInputContext` (Contexts.h)
- [x] Update `WorkspaceInputBridge::sync()` to forward `state.textInput` into `BasicInputContext`
- [x] Rewrite `TextInput::handleInput()` (TextInput.cpp):
  - Click inside → gains focus; click outside → loses focus
  - While focused: printable chars inserted at cursor; `'\b'` removes char before cursor; `'\r'`/`'\n'` defocuses (single-line)
  - Fires `m_onChange` callback whenever text changes
- [x] Add `onInputFocusChanged(bool)` no-op hook to `IHostedTool` interface (IHostedTool.h)
- [x] Update three test stub structs to implement the new `typedText()` method:
  - `TestInputCtx` in `test_widgets_v2.cpp`
  - `TestInputContext` in `test_atlasui.cpp`
  - `WireTestInput` in `test_workspace_wiring.cpp`
- [x] Add `Tests/UI/test_phase68_text_input_wiring.cpp` — 21 test cases / 25 assertions
- [x] Wire `NF_Phase68Tests` into `Tests/CMakeLists.txt`

**Success Criteria:**
- Focused TextInput appends printable typed chars; Backspace removes; Enter defocuses ✓
- `onChange` callback fires on text mutation (type, backspace); does not fire on Enter ✓
- `WorkspaceInputBridge::sync()` forwards textInput including special chars ✓
- All existing UI tests still pass (NF_UITests: 459 assertions, NF_WorkspaceWiringTests: 102 assertions) ✓
- 21 Phase 68 test cases pass (25 assertions) ✓

---

## Phase 69 – Tool Render Contract (Audit Patch 5)

**Status: Done**

Implements the tool render contract fixes identified in the audit backlog.
Before this phase, `WorkspaceRenderer::renderActiveToolView()` called a single
central `renderToolPanelsForCategory()` function that used static placeholder
text for all tools, disconnected from each tool's live runtime state.

- [x] Add `Source/Workspace/include/NF/Workspace/ToolViewRenderContext.h`:
  - `ToolViewRenderContext` struct: `ui`, `mouse`, `x/y/w/h`, `shell` pointer
  - Shared color palette constants (RRGGBBAA: kCardBg, kSurface, kBorder, kAccentBlue, kGreen, kRed, kTextPrimary, kTextSecond, kTextMuted)
  - Helper methods: `drawPanel()`, `drawStatusPill()`, `drawStatRow()`
- [x] Add `virtual void renderToolView(const ToolViewRenderContext&) const {}` to `IHostedTool`
  — forward-declare `ToolViewRenderContext` to avoid circular include via WorkspaceShell
- [x] Implement `renderToolView()` in all 8 core tools (declaration in .h, impl in .cpp):
  - **SceneEditorTool**: Hierarchy (20%) | 3D Viewport (58%) | Inspector (22%) — shows entity/selection counts, edit mode pill, dirty flag
  - **AssetEditorTool**: Content Browser (55%) | Preview (25%) | Inspector (20%) — shows asset counts, filter mode pill
  - **MaterialEditorTool**: Material Graph (35%) | Viewport Preview (40%) | Properties (25%) — shows node/texture slot counts
  - **AnimationEditorTool**: Skeleton/Clips (20%) | Timeline (55%) | Clip Properties (25%) — shows mode, play/rec state, frame count
  - **DataEditorTool**: Tables (25%) | Data Grid (50%) | Inspector (25%) — shows row/col/selection counts
  - **VisualLogicEditorTool**: Node List (20%) | Graph Canvas (60%) | Properties (20%) — shows node/connection counts, error/compile state
  - **BuildTool**: Build Config (25%) | Build Log (55%) | Metrics (20%) — shows mode, errors/warnings, last build time
  - **AtlasAITool**: Session (20%) | Chat/Codex (60%) | Context (20%) — shows message/snippet counts, processing state
- [x] Update `WorkspaceRenderer::renderActiveToolView()` to delegate to `tool->renderToolView(ctx)`
- [x] Add `Tests/Editor/test_phase69_tool_render_contract.cpp` — 23 test cases / 47 assertions
- [x] Wire `NF_Phase69Tests` into `Tests/CMakeLists.txt`

**Success Criteria:**
- `ToolViewRenderContext` color palette constants have correct RRGGBBAA values ✓
- Default `IHostedTool::renderToolView()` no-op emits zero quads ✓
- All 8 core tool `renderToolView()` overrides emit >0 quads and text ✓
- `renderToolView()` is const — does not mutate tool state ✓
- Narrow bounding boxes (50x50) handled without crash ✓
- All 2492 NF_EditorTests assertions still pass ✓
- 23 Phase 69 test cases pass (47 assertions) ✓

---

## Phase 70 – NovaForge Panel Factories (Audit Patch 6)

**Status: Done**

Implements live NovaForge gameplay panel factories identified in the audit backlog.
Before this phase, `GameplaySystemPanelDescriptor::createPanel` was always null in
`NovaForgeAdapter::buildPanelDescriptors()`, meaning `ProjectSystemsTool` could never
instantiate panels on demand.

- [x] Define `class IEditorPanel` fully in `IGameProjectAdapter.h`:
  — `panelId()`, `panelTitle()`, `onProjectLoaded()`, `onProjectUnloaded()`, `update()`, `isReady()`
- [x] Create 6 NovaForge gameplay panel classes in `NovaForge/Source/EditorAdapter/include/NovaForge/EditorAdapter/Panels/`:
  - `EconomyPanel` (`novaforge.economy`) — currency, pricing, economy balance
  - `InventoryRulesPanel` (`novaforge.inventory_rules`) — slot layouts, storage, stacking
  - `ShopPanel` (`novaforge.shop`) — store listings, purchase conditions
  - `MissionRulesPanel` (`novaforge.mission_rules`) — quest objectives, chains, rewards
  - `ProgressionPanel` (`novaforge.progression`) — XP curves, level thresholds, skill unlocks
  - `CharacterRulesPanel` (`novaforge.character_rules`) — creation presets, classes, stat caps
- [x] Wire `createPanel` factory lambdas into all 6 `GameplaySystemPanelDescriptor`s in `NovaForgeAdapter::buildPanelDescriptors()`
- [x] Update `ProjectSystemsTool.h` with live panel caching:
  - `getOrCreatePanel(id)` — lazy instantiation via descriptor factory, cached in `m_livePanels`
  - `findLivePanel(id)` — const lookup of cached instance
  - `livePanelCount()` — count of currently-cached panels
  - `notifyProjectLoaded(root)` / `notifyProjectUnloaded()` — propagate lifecycle to all live panels
  - `reset()` — destroy all cached panels and clear descriptors
  - `loadFromAdapter()` now clears cached panels when switching projects
- [x] Add `Tests/Workspace/test_phase70_novaforge_panel_factories.cpp` — 30 test cases / 119 assertions
- [x] Wire `NF_Phase70Tests` (guarded by `if(TARGET NF::NovaForgeAdapter)`) into `Tests/CMakeLists.txt`

**Success Criteria:**
- All 6 NovaForge panel classes implement `IEditorPanel` correctly ✓
- Panel `isReady()` = false before `onProjectLoaded()`, true after, false after `onProjectUnloaded()` ✓
- All 6 descriptor `createPanel` factories produce valid, non-null `IEditorPanel` instances ✓
- Factory-produced instance `panelId()` matches the descriptor's `id` ✓
- `ProjectSystemsTool::getOrCreatePanel()` returns same instance on repeated calls ✓
- `ProjectSystemsTool::notifyProjectLoaded/Unloaded()` propagates to all live panels ✓
- `ProjectSystemsTool::reset()` destroys all cached panels ✓
- `loadFromAdapter()` discards cached panels from previous adapter ✓
- All 2492 NF_EditorTests assertions still pass ✓
- 30 Phase 70 test cases pass (119 assertions) ✓
